## Overview

The Automatic Code Review Crew is designed to automate the initial code review process in a CI/CD pipeline. It uses three specialized AI agents working collaboratively to:

- **Analyze code quality** - Identify bugs, style issues, and maintainability concerns
- **Review security** - Detect vulnerabilities and assess risk levels  
- **Make decisions** - Approve changes, request fixes, or escalate to human reviewers

## CrewAI Framework Fundamentals

### What is CrewAI?

CrewAI is an open-source Python framework for orchestrating autonomous AI agents. It provides a structured approach to creating teams of specialized agents that collaborate to solve complex tasks. The framework emphasizes:

- **Role-based coordination** - Agents are defined with specific roles, goals, and backstories
- **Task delegation** - Built-in mechanisms for assigning tasks based on agent capabilities
- **Agent collaboration** - Framework for inter-agent communication and knowledge sharing

**Official Documentation:** https://docs.crewai.com/

### Core Components

CrewAI is built around six key pillars:

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Roles** | Define what each agent specializes in |
| **Focus** | Keep agents concentrated on their assigned tasks |
| **Tools** | Equipment for data retrieval, processing, and interaction |
| **Cooperation** | Enable agents to collaborate and delegate |
| **Guardrails** | Safety measures to ensure reliable outputs |
| **Memory** | Store and recall past interactions for better decisions |

---

### Agents

An **Agent** is an autonomous unit programmed to perform tasks, make decisions, and communicate with other agents. Think of an agent as a team member with specific skills and a particular job.

#### Agent Attributes

```python
from crewai import Agent

agent = Agent(
    role="Data Analyst",                    # Job title/function
    goal="Extract actionable insights",     # What they aim to achieve
    backstory="You're an expert analyst...", # Experience and expertise
    verbose=True,                           # Show detailed output
    tools=[search_tool],                    # Available tools
    allow_delegation=False,                 # Can delegate to others
    max_iter=20,                           # Max iterations before answering
    max_rpm=10,                            # Rate limiting
)
```

#### Key Agent Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `role` | `str` | Defines the agent's function within the crew |
| `goal` | `str` | The individual objective the agent aims to achieve |
| `backstory` | `str` | Provides context for the agent's persona and expertise |
| `tools` | `list` | Set of tools the agent can use for tasks |

| `max_rpm` | `int` | Maximum requests per minute (rate limiting) |

---

### Tasks

A **Task** represents a specific assignment to be completed by an agent. Tasks include detailed instructions and define what successful completion looks like.

#### Task Attributes

```python
from crewai import Task

task = Task(
    description="Analyze the code for security issues...",
    expected_output="A JSON report with vulnerabilities...",
    agent=security_agent,
    output_json=SecurityReportSchema,    # Pydantic model for structured output
    guardrails=[validation_function],     # Output validation
    context=[previous_task],              # Results from other tasks
    markdown=True,                        # Output in Markdown format
)
```

#### Key Task Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `description` | `str` | Clear explanation of what the task involves |
| `expected_output` | `str` | Description of the expected result format |
| `agent` | `Agent` | The agent responsible for this task |
| `output_json` | `BaseModel` | Pydantic model for structured JSON output |
| `guardrails` | `list` | Validation functions for output |
| `context` | `list[Task]` | Previous tasks whose outputs provide context |
| `markdown` | `bool` | Format output as Markdown |
| `async_execution` | `bool` | Run task asynchronously |

---

### Crews

A **Crew** is a collaborative group of agents working together to achieve a set of tasks. It orchestrates the workflow, manages agent collaboration, and handles execution.

#### Crew Attributes

```python
from crewai import Crew

crew = Crew(
    agents=[agent1, agent2, agent3],
    tasks=[task1, task2, task3],
    memory=True,                           # Enable memory
    verbose=True,
    process=Process.sequential,            # Task execution order
    before_kickoff_callbacks=[read_hook],  # Pre-execution hooks
    after_kickoff_callbacks=[save_hook],   # Post-execution hooks
)

# Execute the crew
result = crew.kickoff(inputs={"topic": "AI"})
```

#### Key Crew Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `agents` | `list[Agent]` | List of agents in the crew |
| `tasks` | `list[Task]` | List of tasks to be executed |
| `memory` | `bool` | Enable memory for the crew |
| `process` | `Process` | Execution process type (sequential/hierarchical) |
| `before_kickoff_callbacks` | `list` | Functions to run before execution |
| `after_kickoff_callbacks` | `list` | Functions to run after execution |
| `max_rpm` | `int` | Global rate limit for the crew |

#### Kickoff Methods

```python
# Standard execution
result = crew.kickoff(inputs={"topic": "AI"})

# Execute for multiple inputs
results = crew.kickoff_for_each(inputs=[
    {"topic": "AI"},
    {"topic": "ML"}
])

# Asynchronous execution
result = await crew.kickoff_async(inputs={"topic": "AI"})
```

---

### Tools

**Tools** are capabilities that agents can use to interact with external services, databases, or APIs.

#### Built-in Tools

CrewAI provides several built-in tools through `crewai_tools`:

```python
from crewai_tools import SerperDevTool, ScrapeWebsiteTool

# Web search tool
search_tool = SerperDevTool(search_url="https://owasp.org")

# Website scraping tool  
scrape_tool = ScrapeWebsiteTool()

# Assign to agent
agent = Agent(
    role="Researcher",
    tools=[search_tool, scrape_tool],
    ...
)
```

#### Common Built-in Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `SerperDevTool` | Search the web via Serper API |
| `ScrapeWebsiteTool` | Scrape content from websites |
| `FileReadTool` | Read files from the filesystem |
| `DirectoryReadTool` | Read directory contents |
| `PDFSearchTool` | Search within PDF documents |
| `WebsiteSearchTool` | Search specific websites |

---

### Memory

**Memory** allows agents to remember and learn from past interactions, improving decision-making over time.

#### Memory Types

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Short-term Memory** | Stores information from the current execution |
| **Long-term Memory** | Retains data across multiple executions |
| **Entity Memory** | Remembers key entities encountered |
| **Contextual Memory** | Maintains context between interactions |

#### Enabling Memory

```python
crew = Crew(
    agents=[...],
    tasks=[...],
    memory=True,  # Enable memory
)
```

When memory is enabled, agents can:
- Remember previously identified patterns
- Recognize recurring issues
- Build upon past experiences
- Make more consistent decisions

---

### Guardrails

**Guardrails** validate and transform task outputs before they're passed to the next task, ensuring data quality and reliability.

#### Types of Guardrails

1. **Function-based Guardrails**: Python functions with custom validation logic
2. **LLM-based Guardrails**: String descriptions for natural language validation

#### Function-based Guardrail Example

```python
from typing import Tuple, Any

def validate_output(output) -> Tuple[bool, Any]:
    """
    Guardrail function to validate task output.
    
    Returns:
        (True, validated_result) on success
        (False, "Error message") on failure
    """
    try:
        json_output = output.json_dict
        
        # Validate required fields
        if 'required_field' not in json_output:
            return (False, "Missing required field")
        
        # Validation passed
        return (True, json_output)
        
    except Exception as e:
        return (False, f"Validation error: {str(e)}")

# Apply to task
task = Task(
    description="...",
    guardrails=[validate_output],
    ...
)
```

#### Multiple Guardrails

```python
task = Task(
    description="...",
    guardrails=[
        validate_word_count,    # Function-based
        validate_format,        # Function-based
        "Must be professional"  # LLM-based
    ],
    guardrail_max_retries=3,   # Retry on failure
    ...
)
```

---

### Execution Hooks

**Execution Hooks** are callbacks that run before or after crew execution, allowing you to inject custom logic.

#### Before Kickoff Hook

Runs before agents start their work. Useful for preprocessing inputs.

```python
def read_file_hook(inputs: dict) -> dict:
    """Read a file and add contents to inputs."""
    filename = inputs.get("file_path")
    
    with open(filename, "r") as f:
        inputs["file_content"] = f.read()
    
    return inputs

crew = Crew(
    agents=[...],
    tasks=[...],
    before_kickoff_callbacks=[read_file_hook],
)
```

#### After Kickoff Hook

Runs after all tasks complete. Useful for saving results or cleanup.

```python
def save_result_hook(result):
    """Save the final result to a file."""
    if hasattr(result, 'tasks_output'):
        content = result.tasks_output[-1].raw
        
        with open("output.md", "w") as f:
            f.write(content)
    
    return result

crew = Crew(
    agents=[...],
    tasks=[...],
    after_kickoff_callbacks=[save_result_hook],
)
```

---

### Process Types

CrewAI supports different execution processes:

#### Sequential Process

Tasks are executed one after another in order. Each task's output can be used as context for the next.

```python
crew = Crew(
    agents=[agent1, agent2],
    tasks=[task1, task2],
    process=Process.sequential,  # Default
)
```

#### Hierarchical Process

A manager agent coordinates the crew, delegating tasks and validating outcomes.

```python
from crewai import Process

crew = Crew(
    agents=[agent1, agent2],
    tasks=[task1, task2],
    process=Process.hierarchical,
    manager_llm=ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4"),  # Required
)
```

---

## Application Architecture

The pipeline mirrors the visual in the Agents and Tasks Diagram: three agents own one task each, handing results left-to-right. In order:

- **Senior Developer → Analyze Code Quality** produces structured findings (critical/minor) from the PR diff.
- **Security Engineer → Review Security** investigates vulnerabilities, assigns risk levels, and marks blocking vs. non-blocking.
- **Tech Lead → Make Review Decision** combines both outputs to approve, request changes, or escalate, returning the final Markdown report.

Memory remains enabled across runs for pattern recognition, and guardrails validate security outputs and the final decision format.

### OWASP Top 10 Coverage

The `review_security` task now maps findings to the OWASP Top 10 (A01–A10). Its output includes an `owasp_top_10` list where each entry has `id` (A01-A10), `name`, `status` (`not_observed`, `needs_attention`, `confirmed`), and supporting `evidence` or a `not_applicable` reason. Each vulnerability in `security_vulnerabilities` should also reference the relevant OWASP category.

### Recommendation Report Task

The `write_recommendation_report` task produces a Markdown summary at report/recommendations.md. It pulls from Analyze Code Quality, Review Security (including OWASP mapping), and Make Review Decision to list critical/minor issues, security risks, the final decision, and prioritized fixes.

## Usage

### Running the Application

1. **Place your PR diff in `code_changes.txt`:**

```diff
diff --git a/app/auth.py b/app/auth.py
--- a/app/auth.py
+++ b/app/auth.py
@@ -1,5 +1,10 @@
 def login(username, password):
+    # Vulnerable to SQL injection
     user = db.query(f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE name='{username}'")
```

2. **Run the application:**

```bash
python main.py
```

3. **View the output:**

The crew will analyze the code and provide a decision:
- ✅ **Approve** - Code meets quality standards
- 🔄 **Request Changes** - Issues need to be fixed
- ⚠️ **Escalate** - Human review required

### Programmatic Usage

```python
from main import AutomaticCodeReviewCrew

# Initialize the crew
crew = AutomaticCodeReviewCrew(verbose=True)

# Run a review
result = crew.review("path/to/code_changes.txt")

# Access the final decision
print(result.tasks_output[-1].raw)
