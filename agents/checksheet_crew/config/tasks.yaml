extract_cheatsheet:
  description: >
    Extract the OWASP cheat sheet at the provided URL into a structured JSON
    that matches the application's checksheet schema. Use the scraped content
    and provide complete fields whenever possible. Focus on identifying risks,
    impacts, mitigations, and examples. If a field cannot be found, use an empty
    value instead of guessing.
  expected_output: >
    A JSON object following the ChecksheetJSON schema with all required fields
    populated.

validate_cheatsheet:
  description: >
    Validate and normalize the extracted checksheet JSON to ensure it is
    consistent with the schema and safe to load into the application. Fix
    missing optional fields with defaults and normalize severities to
    Critical/High/Medium/Low.
  expected_output: >
    A corrected and normalized ChecksheetJSON object.
